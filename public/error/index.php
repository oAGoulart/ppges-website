  400 Bad Request

The 400 status code, or Bad Request error, means the HTTP request that was sent to the server has invalid syntax.

Here are a few examples of when a 400 Bad Request error might occur:

    The user’s cookie that is associated with the site is corrupt. Clearing the browser’s cache and cookies could solve this issue
    Malformed request due to a faulty browser
    Malformed request due to human error when manually forming HTTP requests (e.g. using curl incorrectly)
